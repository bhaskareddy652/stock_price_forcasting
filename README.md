# Apple Stock Price Forecasting
## Business Objective
Help investors, traders, and financial analysts monitor stock prices to make informed buy/sell decisions. The goal is to predict Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) stock price for the next 30 days based on financial, economic, and sentiment-related variables.
## Target Variable
stock_price

Definition: The historical stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) over time.

## Features

## nasdaq_index

Definition: The NASDAQ Composite Index, tracking over 3,000 tech and growth companies, including Apple.

Impact: Since Apple is a major NASDAQ component, its stock price moves in correlation with NASDAQ trends. Traders consider NASDAQ trends before investing in Apple stock.

## sp500_index

Definition: The S&P 500 Index, tracking the 500 largest U.S. companies, including Apple.

Impact: Large market movements in the S&P 500 affect Apple's stock price. Investors compare Apple’s performance with the S&P 500 to assess risk and relative strength.

## inflation_rate

Definition: The percentage increase in the price of goods/services over time.

Impact: Higher inflation reduces consumer purchasing power, affecting Apple's product sales (iPhones, MacBooks, etc.). The Federal Reserve may adjust interest rates to control inflation, affecting Apple's borrowing costs.

## unemployment_rate

Definition: The percentage of people unemployed but actively seeking jobs.

Impact: Higher unemployment reduces consumer spending on non-essential products like iPhones and MacBooks.

## interest_rate

Definition: The cost of borrowing money, set by the Federal Reserve (U.S.).

Impact: Affects Apple’s debt financing and expansion plans. Higher interest rates make loans expensive, reducing Apple's profitability.

## market_sentiment

Definition: A numerical score (-1 to +1) indicating public perception of Apple stock from news, social media, and analyst reports.

Impact: Investors use sentiment analysis to gauge public reaction to earnings reports, lawsuits, product launches, etc.
